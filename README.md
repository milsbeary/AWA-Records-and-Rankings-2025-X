# AWA-Records-and-Rankings-2025-X
All scripts used by the Alberta Weightlifting Association (AWA) to maintain athlete rankings and records from 2025 onward. All scripts are coded in Python and run using Google Colab within AWA's google drive. 

You can visit AWAs website [here](https://albertaweightlifting.com/). The current and provincial AWA rankings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vQANNdom0Tcg8SnjQck6d2VCHBO07yaC9eR6szFPugmAAY_iRbaqbuOHAv4HhodWWKyYIr95AO5EAm7/pubhtml).

Please use the most recent versions of the rankings and records codes for best results. The previous verions are kept in this repository for archival purposes. 

To use these sheets you will need to update the paths in each notebook to match your own. 
For the records and rankings update sheet, you will need to specify if you are operating with .xlsx and or google sheets with each used sheet. There are instructions for how do do this in the notebook. 
It is importent to note that each one of these notebooks is intended to be run in Google Colab and interact with a Google Drive as oposed to locally. It is highly recomended that you upload all of the sheets and code to your Google Drive and update there.
